Description:       "The Oncotype DX test for DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma in Situ) breast cancer. Risk scores range from 0 to 100 with the following interpretations: 0-38: Low-Risk, 39-54: Intermediate-Risk, 55+: High-Risk.
No LOINC code currently exists for this test. We are seeking feedback on the value of separating OncotypeDx scores for DCIS and invasive breast carcinomas. Does it make more sense to report the OncotypeDx as a single score, regardless of the type of cancer?"

Description:       "Breast cancer genomic signature assay for 10-year risk of distant recurrence score calculated by Prosigna.
The Prosigna Score is reported on a 0-100 scale (referred to as ROR Score or Risk of Recurrence Score in the literature), which is correlated with the probability of distant recurrence at ten years for post-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive, early stage breast cancer."
